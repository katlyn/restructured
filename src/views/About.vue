      Created by Katlyn Lorimer for Dr. Jerome's fall 2021 Chem F103 class at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built with Vue, Typescript, and chemistry textbooks.

      While this website does have a decent set of features, it unfortunately doesn't support all features that I had
      initially wanted to implement, such as ionic compounds, validation of multiple compounds in the same structure,
      quizzes on building structures, etc. These may be implemented in the future, but who knows.
